BigIdeal.m2
===========

This package generates the ideals defined in the paper [Ideals with Larger Projective Dimension and Regularity](http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.3368) by J. Beder, J. McCullough, L. Nunez, A. Seceleanu, [B. Snapp](https://github.com/bartsnapp) and B. Stone. As the title of the paper suggests, these ideals have very large projective dimension and regularity relative to the degree and number of generators.
